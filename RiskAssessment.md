## 2. Risk evaluation
- Possible exposure:
  - Subject -> Researcher (Very unlikely)
  - Sample -> Researcher (Very unlikely)
- Possible release:
  - Sample getting stolen (Unlikely)
  - Sample not being taken care of properly (Unlikely)
  - Sample getting lost (Unlikely)
- Influence to exposure:
  - Inadequate PPE
  - Malevolent act
  - Irresponsibility
- Influence to release:
  - Inadequate PPE
  - Malevolent act
  - Irresponsibility
- Consequences: personal ranging;
  - On open wound: infection, maybe RS
  - On aerosol: light symptoms
- Overall initial risk level: 15%
- Acceptable risk level: 5%
- Acceptable risks: Slight margin of human error involving sampling
- Unacceptable risks: Human error due to incompetence or low concentration
- Unacceptable risks controllable: True

## 3. Risk mitigation
- Resources available:
  - PPE
  - Education
- Risk control steps:
  - PPE when sampling: (FPP2 mask) with (eye protection or face shield) with (gloves)
  - Education on proper sampling techniques and subject behaviour control.
  - PPE when investigating: FFP2 mask with eye protection with gloves
  - Investigation environment: closed laboratory, one table
  - Disinfection: Bleach solution, 15%; alcohol; hand wash.
- Measures sufficient: True
- Measures effective: True
- Measures sustainable: True
- Measures achievable: True
- Risk mitigation: 10%-12%
