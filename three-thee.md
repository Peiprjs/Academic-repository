> Are you... me?
## Abstract
This theory links Freud's theories on the ego, super-ego and Id with the three main theories on the human being: rational, irrational and blank slate (*Tabula Rassa*). This link is purely theoretical and relies on previous theories. This theory dictates that each being is actually a group of inner beings (or "thees").
