## Abstract
This theory links Freud’s arguments on the ego, super-ego and Id with the three major philosophies regarding the human being: as a rational being, as an irrational being and as a blank slate. The link is theoretical and relies on earlier theories. It dictates that every being is internally a group of inner beings (or “thees”), and that the quantity varies between the different species capable of essential cognition (if basic thought is considered being able to give an acceptable response to external inputs, the list of which may be a carbon copy of those species considered “alive”). Humans have three: the *cubile*, which takes care of the survival instincts and is similar to Freud’s Id; the *cogitatio*, which does analytical processing (everything related to logic, such as mathematics or science); and the *caetus*, which governs the human need for social relationships.
